Scientists worldwide are advancing their research by using bioinformatics to generate hypotheses, analyse data and etc. Months or years of failure could be saved by bioinformatics and lacking bioinformatics skills could prevent you from getting a research job!\r\n\r\nThis course aims at introducing basic concepts of bioinformatics and its applications to graduate students as well as helping them develop ideas and skills to use bioinformatics in their research through hands-on training. Skills developed in this course could be further used in advanced courses in data science and health informatics. \r\n\r\n### Prerequisite\r\n\r\nBasic knowledge in molecular genetics and biology is required as well as strong interest in biology and medicine. No background in computing and programming is required.\r\n\r\n### Course outlines (draft)\r\n\r\nThe course covers basic introduction to a wide range of topics include:\r\n* Basic bioinformatics algorithms\r\n* Online bioinformatics tools for research\r\n* Biological databases\r\n* Research applications in:\r\n    * Sequence analysis (DNA, gene and protein)\r\n    * Protein structure analysis\r\n    * Protein-protein interaction\r\n    * System biology\r\n    * Next-generation sequencing technology data analysis\r\n    * Drug discovery\r\n* Data management\r\n\r\n### Learning Methodolody\r\n\r\nAmong other things, the problem-based learning is the main methodology of this course. A student is given a problem from the beginning of each section to trigger him/her to think about how the problem can be solved with or without using bioinformatics. Students then study related research publications and discuss in class on various aspects to develop an idea on how bioinformatics can be helpful. Basic algorithms behind related bioinformatics tools are introduced by a series of lectures and tutorials. Students also develop skills from hands-on practices using mostly **online bioinformatics tools**.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nA student is evaluated based on class participation (50%), practices (30%), assignments (10%) and a final exam (10%).\r\n\r\n### Venue\r\n\r\nThe class meets in a classroom (TBA) for a lecture & discussion and a computer room (316) for hands-on practices.\r\n\r\n### Recommended text books\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### Main Course Coordinator\r\n* Likit Preeyanon, Ph.D. (Microbiology & Molecular Genetics and Quantitative Biology)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nFor more information please contact: likit.pre@mahidol.edu",
